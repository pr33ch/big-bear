Terminal commands for testing out HTTP request parsing:

After building, in one terminal:
$ bin/server 8080

In another terminal, I used nc to send an example GET request:
$ printf "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Agent: nc/0.0.1\r\nHost: 127.0.0.1\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 8080

Test other mmessages by doing:
$ printf "whatever message here" | nc localhost 8080

There might be a better way of doing this, but this is all I know so far
